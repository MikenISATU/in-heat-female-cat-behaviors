 Web-Based Behavioral Early Detection of In-Heat Cycle in Female Cats

Hello everyone,

We are a group of Computer Science students from Iloilo Science and Technology University, currently working on our thesis titled "Web-Based Behavioral Early Detection of In-Heat Cycle in Female Cats." Our study aims to create a system using OpenCV library, YOLO, and ConVet to detect in-heat behaviors of female cats during the estrus stage. This system will be web-based and designed to help cat owners who have busy schedules to monitor their cats' behaviors effectively.

Request:

We are kindly requesting access to relevant datasets related to in-heat behaviors of female cats. Having access to such datasets would significantly contribute to the success of our research and enhance the credibility of our findings. The dataset should ideally contain video recordings or annotated data of female cats exhibiting in-heat behaviors during the estrus stage.

Intended Use:

The dataset will be solely used for academic and research purposes to train and evaluate our deep learning models for in-heat behavior detection. We will not use the data for any commercial or non-research activities.

Data Usage and Privacy:

We fully understand the importance of data privacy and ethical considerations. If your organization or individual can provide us with the dataset, we assure you that the data will be used strictly for research purposes and will be kept confidential. Any data sharing agreements or restrictions will be honored.

Attribution:

We respect the effort put into collecting and preparing the dataset. In any publication or presentation resulting from our research, we will give proper attribution to the original data sources as per your requirements.

If you are willing to share the dataset or have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us through the following channels:
